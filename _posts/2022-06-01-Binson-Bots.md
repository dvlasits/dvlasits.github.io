Binson Bots is the society in Robinson I co-founded. It has the goal of helping everyone irrespective or their Computer Science get a feeling of programming, what's it like and how to use it.


We got some very interesting advice from the Raspberry Pi Foundation about what a curriculum should look like. The most interesting advice was that the problem should be put in context as that significantly levels the playing field and gets a more diverse group interested in programming. I.e. don't setup artificial coding projects.


We decided robots would be great at achieving this, as we could set exercises with them, and students could write a few lines of code and then they could already remote control them and most importantly **see their code DOING something.** Which I think is absolutely vital to get people involved and excited. 


And here are some photos of students coding away and being taught :). We also go and help out at the Raspberry Pi foundation helping younger primary school students get excited about coding too!
