I am beginning an exciting journey by working on a startup called Frozen Data. 

[Here](https://www.frozendata.co.uk/) is the website!

Here is a nice summary of what we are trying to do:


Hello our company is Frozen Data and we want to help businesses accepting crypto as payment improve the efficiency of their marketing strategies. In this area there are three key metrics to look at, customer acquisition, conversion and retention. Currently Businesses worldwide spend north of a 100 billion dollars on Google ads alone, which come with only under 3% click through rate on average. Then, of these who make it to the landing page of the business only around 3% end up making a purchase. From here around 30% become loyal customers. This means that at the end only 1 out of more than 3000 users targeted by the business become regularly paying customers. All of this highlights just how important it is to make correct decisions when deciding which potential customers to target, how to get them into making a purchase and finally getting them to stay with the business for a long haul, as wrong decisions will directly lead to lower revenues and wasted resources.


So how do we want to solve this? We want to analyse all the publicly available information about customers’ transactions stored on blockchain and provide them to businesses in highly actionable ways. By using machine learning we will be able to create powerful models helping businesses with marketing on each of the three stages of the pipeline. We will be able to predict, which potential customers are most likely to interact with the business, to help them with more targeted advertising. By analysing the digital goods of the potential customer as well as all their previous transactions, we could provide businesses with powerful recommendation engines, ready to use instantaneously on the customer’s first login. Finally, for the purposes of retention we will inform businesses about their customers’ interactions with competition, so they can react quickly and keep their customers loyal.


There is already 12TB of data available solely on the Ethereum blockchain and what’s powerful about it is that this data is purely transactional and comes from more than 70 million wallets. This makes it directly relevant to what we want to predict, and gives us potential to unlock very powerful machine learning models. Secondly all the new transactions that come in globally can be actively monitored in real time, which gives us a million transactions we can inform our customers about every day.


Some of you might notice that there is a slight issue here. It is true that all data we are analysing is relevant only to businesses accepting cryptocurrency as payments whether that be an online or physical store, which does not have widespread traction at the moment. However, there is already significant traction in the sector of digital goods, which sees almost 25 billion dollars of yearly revenue. Additionally, a study done by Deloitte predicts that in the next 2 years 75% of businesses will move into accepting crypto. We have also spoken to NFT marketplaces which have told us they need a better data analytics pipeline but don’t have the resources to create it themselves.


Thanks to all the properties of blockchain technology that we mentioned previously, we have implemented a prototype that can alert a shop within 10 seconds that their customer has gone to a competitor all the while without knowing any demographic or name information. This new tool will allow them to respond quicker to leavers and take early action.


We now also have a database with 100 million transactions in that we are using to develop our machine learning models.


As for our business model, we will make it a software as a service. We will charge businesses depending on the number of customers they would want analysed, the number of distinct calls they would make to our API and the relative complexity of the queries they request.


As for our competitors, There are many companies which analyse blockchain transactions in the interests of financial institutions for the purposes of compliance. One of these companies “chainalysis” has taken its compliance technology and created a product for businesses, ; however, we believe we can come up with a more personalised solution. There are also of course many traditional analytics companies such as google analytics which track all demographics possible, but also don’t analyse the massive amounts of transactional data we are.

We are two computer science students at Cambridge, have both successfully won prizes at major international blockchain hackathons and are now at the judge business schools accelerator program so we believe we’re the right people to do this.

We are now looking for clients and investors, so if you can connect us with either of these please let us know.
