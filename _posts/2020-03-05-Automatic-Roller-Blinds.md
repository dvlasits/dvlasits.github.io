For my tech project, I decided to make an automatic roller blind. I used Solidworks a lot to design the product and then coded in python. I made an app for it to be controlled and settings set on the phone and also wrote code so that it would work with my google home.


Here is the final render of the product.

Here it is all 3d printed and screwed together:

Here it is screwed up and ready to go!

And here are some videos of it in action:

Here is a demo of controlling it with an app:

Here is a demo without the blind:
