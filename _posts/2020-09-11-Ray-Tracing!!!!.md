I am currently doing an "Introduction to Graphics" at University. One of the assignments we had was to do some of the implementation for a ray tracing algorithm. The University supplied the boiler plate and we had to fill in the details of the how it would calculate what colour each pixel should be based of the ray going through it. Here is one of the stunning photos it generated:
